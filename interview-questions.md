# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer: Props allows for a developer to take information from the parent class to the child class. Props are read only so there is no way that the content should be modified.

  Researched answer: Props stands for properties. They are arguments that are passed through components and they are only read only. Compared to state which manages the data. State can only be accessed within the component that it lays in and thats where props comes in. You can pass data from one component to another.



2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: DOM event happens when something on the screen happens. DOM stands for Document Object Model.

  Researched answer: Events can refer to either the change made by a user or browser. Clicking on a link or a refreshing browser would both be considered events.



3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: I don't remember exactly what object oriented programming. I have used it for sure and just by the name I can assume that with that programming its going to be object based.

  Researched answer: Function is a collection of demand and data. Object on the other hand is a collection of functions and data. OOP is a style of programming that takes classes of objects. Upon further research in functional programming data cannot be stored in objects, while in OOP data can be stored in objects.



4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer: In Ruby, I know that everything can be considered a class. Float and integer are two seperate classes. When you are calling on integer it can only give you whole numbers while float you can get decimals. It looks like this. Float: 1.0, Integer: 1. That point zero makes a huge difference in the outcome.

  Researched answer: Both float and integer are its on class. The decimal point is what tells each apart. You can get a value of 138.0 and 138. When that data is injected into Ruby the decimal makes a huge difference. That decimal point tells the computer whether it's a float or a integer. Anything without a decimal point will be counted towards integer while float is every valuable with a decimal point.



5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: Implicit return means that within the Ruby language there is no need to return the last line of code in your code block. It will do that for you.

  Researched answer: In Ruby you do not need to call on return to return the last value of the last line of code. Explicit return is the opposite and we've seen it in JavaScript. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Instance Variable: So where the instance class would be located in a class outside of a method. I found out that it has values to it which would be 0, and the boolean would be false. You can call the variable by calling its name and only inside the class because that's where it is.

2. PostgreSQL: It is an open source database that has more than 30 years of active development. It came from a project at UC Berkeley. It's good to use because it protecs its data.  

3. Ruby on Rails: Rails is a full stack framework that deals with both the back and the front end. It's saying that it is a mix between HTML and Ruby.

4. ORM: Stands dor Object-Relational-Mapper. It allows for the developer to write Python code instead of creating SQL.

5. Active Record: You use Actice Record when you want to retrieve objects from a database and active record give you several methods to choose from.
